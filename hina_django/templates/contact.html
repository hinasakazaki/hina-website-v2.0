          I make a <div class = "link"> <a href= "https://twitter.com/swaggerzaki/status/465708315188539392" target="_blank"> new social media account </a>  </div> just about every semester, just so I can procrastinate on finals week. <br> <br>

          This means that you can reach me at many places. I'll categorize so it's easier for you.<br> <br>

        Just feel free to email me. Since I'm no longer President of CSUA, I don't get 50+ emails per day, so I'll be sure to get back to you. 

        <br> <br>

        I realize that there's no real "About Me" section, for two reasons: (1) the whole site is an "About Me". (2) The front page is kind of like a blog post with recent updates, no real "About Me." So I'll just tuck it in here. It'll be a surprise gift (?) for those of you who wanted to contact me. 

        <br> <br>

        Born in Japan, I lived in Singapore for two years, Ehime for three years, and Tokyo for a few months, and California for the rest of my life. I came to the United States when I was seven. 

        <br> <br>

        Other than my four person family, the rest of my relatives live in Japan. I have a sister who is two years younger than me who goes to CalTech. She is brilliant and beautiful, just like me. Hahaha.
